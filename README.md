# Project Title

A TelegramBot written in C# targeting .NET Core 3.1 to be platform independent. The idea is to have an interface with cachet via Telegram chat to either update components manually, to retrieve the status of components or probably to even get notifications by polling cachet ever X minutes.


### Dependencies

The following are used by myself:
* .NET Core 3.1
* the official [Telegram.Bot API](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot) (linked in the solution)
* Newtonsoft.Json

## Deployment

Should be simple, build the solution and run the exe.

## Built With
